### Data Streaming with Apache Kafka & PySpark

This repository are for learning purposes for creating Data Streaming pipelines with Apache Kafka & Spark (PySpark). The project idea is simple, create a pipeline which use a python program to takes input as the kafka producer and then consumed by Apache Spark to process and store it in local Postgres (or BigQuery in the future) within docker. The full documentation will be written here when the project is done.

Any comments are welcome. Thank you!
